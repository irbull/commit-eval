Evaluate the following commit message and determine how well it explains the change-set.
In particular, rate the commit message as either "Excellent" or "Revisable".

1. If the commit message is clear, concise, and explains the change-set well, rate it as "Excellent".
2. If the commit message is unclear, incomplete, or does not explain the change-set well, rate it as "Revisable".

If the commit message is "Revisable" suggest a better message using the following format:
{% if let Some(conventional_commit) = conventional_commit %}
1. Use the "conventional commit" style for the title that includes `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
2. Use proper sentences in the body and use paragraph breaks where needed.

The existing message had the following conventional commit properties:
- Commit Type: {{ conventional_commit.commit_type }}
- Description: {{ conventional_commit.commit_type }}
- Body: {{ conventional_commit.body|display_some }}
{% else %}
1. Split the suggested commit message into a `Title` that completes the sense `If applied, this commit will <title>` (maximum 52 characters long);
2. and a "Body" that explains the change-set in detail using proper sentences and paragraph breaks.
{% endif %}
Return the result as JSON.

If the commit message is rated as "Excellent", just return the existing Title and Body. 
If the commit message is rated as "Revisable", return the suggested Title and Body.

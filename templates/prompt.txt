Evaluate the following commit message and determine how well it explains the change-set. In particular, rate the commit message as either "Complete", "Adequate", or "Incomplete". Provide a reason for the analysis.

Suggest a better message:

Split the suggested commit message into a "Title" that completes the sense "If applied, this commit will <title>" (maximum 52 characters long) and a "Body". Use proper sentences in the suggested body, not point form. Wrap at 72 characters, and use paragraph breaks where needed. Return the result as JSON.

If the commit message is rated as "Complete", just return the existing Title and Body.

The commit message is:

{{commit_message}}

and the code diff is:

{{code_diff}}
